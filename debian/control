Description: Project Calico networking for OpenStack/Neutron.
 Project Calico is an open source solution for virtual networking in
 cloud data centers. It uses IP routing to provide connectivity
 between the workloads in a data center that provide or use IP-based
 services - whether VMs, containers or bare metal appliances; and
 iptables, to impose any desired fine-grained security policy between
 those workloads.
 .
 This package provides the pieces needed on a compute node.
